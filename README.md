### Local

* Nucl2vec: https://github.com/prakharg24/Nucl2vec
    * local alignment only - could it be adapted to semi-global?
    * Can re-implement in SpaCy? https://spacy.io/usage/vectors-similarity

### Semi-global

[Semi-global alignment](
http://www.bioinf.uni-freiburg.de/Lehre/Courses/2013_SS/V_Bioinformatik_1/lecture4.pdf) is global alignment with an optional gap at the end(s).

* SeqPurge algorithm: insert match algorithm that performs thresholded exhaustive
   comparison to minimize probability of incorrect alignment. Relies on the fact that
   overlapping reads share alleles and indels (i.e. no gaps are required) (in C++).
